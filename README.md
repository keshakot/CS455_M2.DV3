Behavior Tree (logic and movement): Assets/Scripts/BehaviorTreeMovement.cs

# Description
1. Use the buttons in the game to select the state of the door (locked, closed, or open).  
2. The player will then respectively barge, open, or walk through the doorway unhindered to it's destination on the other side.  

# Notes
1. The player movement is 'jerky'. This is because the movement is done in one frame and not through the Update() function.
